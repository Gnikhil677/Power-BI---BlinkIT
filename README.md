This feature enhances the dashboard‚Äôs flexibility, enabling users to explore the same visual structure using different KPIs for a more comprehensive analysis.


#### **1. Total Sales by Fat Content**

A **donut chart** displays the breakdown of total sales by fat content:

* **Low Fat**: \$425.36K
* **Regular**: \$776.32K
* **Total Sales**: \$1.20M

This helps assess consumer preferences between low-fat and regular products.


#### **2. Fat Content by Outlet Tier**

A **stacked bar chart** shows how sales for low fat and regular products vary across city tiers:

* **Tier 3**: \$0.31M
* **Tier 2**: \$0.25M
* **Tier 1**: \$0.22M

This comparison highlights how dietary preferences and product performance differ by market segment.


#### **3. Total Sales by Item Type**

A **horizontal bar chart** ranks item categories based on total sales:

* Top contributors include **Fruits and Vegetables**, **Snack Foods**, and **Household Items**, each generating over \$0.14M.

#### **1. Outlet Establishment Performance Over Time**

A **line and area chart** illustrates sales trends based on the year of outlet establishment.

* Revenue peaked at **\$205K** in one year, indicating a standout performance.
* Earlier establishments started lower (e.g., **\$78K**), and newer ones show varied performance.
  This trend helps track the **impact of outlet maturity** on revenue generation.


#### **2. Outlet Size Distribution**

A **donut chart** breaks down sales by **outlet size**:

* **High-size outlets** lead with **\$507.90K**
* **Medium** and **Small** outlets contribute **\$444.79K** and **\$248.99K**, respectively
  This breakdown helps assess whether larger outlets consistently perform better.


#### **3. Outlet Location (City Tier-wise)**

A **bar chart** displays total sales by **city tier**:

* **Tier 3 cities** top the list with **\$472.13K**

A **detailed matrix** compares key KPIs across different **outlet types**:

* **Supermarket Type 1** dominates with **\$7.87M** in total sales and the highest item visibility (339 items)
* All outlet types maintain consistent **average ratings of 4**
* Other types such as **Grocery Stores**, **Supermarket Type 2**, and **Supermarket Type 3** show similar average sales (\~\$140‚Äì\$141), but differ in item counts and visibility


## ‚öôÔ∏è**Filter Panel**
